# 🔵 FPGA Single-Layer Neural Network Inference (VHDL)
Hardware implementation of a single-layer Fully Connected neural network on the Intel/Altera DE2-115 FPGA board.
The design performs fixed-point inference using dedicated MAC hardware, ROM-based weights, and an FSM-controlled datapath.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **Bachelor’s degree final project in Electrical and Electronics Engineering**.

A single-layer Fully Connected model was **trained in Python using Google Colab** on the **MNIST digit classification dataset**. After training, the learned **weights, biases, and selected test-image pixels** were exported and converted into `.mif` memory files for FPGA use.

The FPGA implementation performs only the **inference stage**, mapping the neural computation into hardware using:

* Fixed-point arithmetic
* A custom Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) hardware block
* ROM-based weight & bias storage
* A deterministic, cycle-accurate control FSM
* RTL design in VHDL + ModelSim simulation + Quartus compilation for DE2-115

The hardware inference running on the FPGA was **compared to CPU inference running on Google Colab**, and the FPGA achieved a **~14× reduction in latency**, demonstrating the efficiency of hardware acceleration.

The project includes a full PDF report (~80 pages) detailing the architecture, implementation, results, and design trade-offs.
